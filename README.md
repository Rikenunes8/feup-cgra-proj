# CGRA 2020/2021

Project for the Computer Graphics course @ FEUP 2020/2021

The main goal of this project was to develop a 3D Fish game in JavaScript by elaborating a 3D scene and the game logic.
From an empty 3D scene we make the scene described in the [report](https://github.com/Rikenunes8/feup-cgra-proj/blob/master/project/README.md), as well as the game.
The game consists on a fish moving under the water whose duty is to pick up stones from the ground and drop them on its nest.
